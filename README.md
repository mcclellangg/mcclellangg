### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Grayson!

<p align="left">I am a passionate software developer who loves learning! Currently trying to fill gaps in my knowledge in my free time. Feel free to shoot me a message, and say what's up! ðŸ˜„</p>

- ðŸ‘· I'm currently working on running a 5e D&D campaign with my friends. Most of my contributions these days are to private repos that I use for all of my session prep work. Maybe one day it could be a complete module! :thinking:

- ðŸŽ¨ My work is on display at [https://mcclellangg.github.io/](https://mcclellangg.github.io/)

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at **mcclellangg@gmail.com**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my current favorite emoji, as of today it is âœ¨!
